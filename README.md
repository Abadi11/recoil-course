# Excalidraw Clone built with Recoil

This is the start of an [Exaclidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) clone that I am building with [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/).

It is for my **upcoming free Recoil course**, [Learn Recoil](https://learnrecoil.com/), where I will show you how to build a **full featured Excalidraw clone using Recoil** for state management.

I'm planning to include (and what you'll learn to build) is:

-   Rotating
-   Multi-select
-   More shapes
-   Saving a drawing to a file and opening it again
-   Saving the drawing to a server (shareable drawing URL)
-   Loading content (e.g. images) from an API
-   Enabling concurrent mode
-   Full test coverage
-   Building your own dev tools for debugging
-   Authentication
-   Performance debugging and testing
-   And more...
